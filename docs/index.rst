   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to flask-skeleton's documentation!
==========================================

Currently, this documentation assumes an intermediate knowledge of Flask.
Blueprints in particular are integral to the application and understanding
it. I aim to build a more complete instructional guide once the codebase
settles down a bit.

For now, http://exploreflask.com/en/latest/ is a good resource before you
dive into this one.
